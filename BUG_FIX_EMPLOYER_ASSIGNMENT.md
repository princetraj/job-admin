# Bug Fix: Employer Assignment Issue

## 🐛 Bug Report

**Issue**: When trying to assign an employer to a coupon using phone number (9995699955), the system was showing "User not found" error.

**Location**: Admin Panel → Coupon Details → Assign Users Dialog

**Reported**: Coupon ID `e835a0f4-90f5-4415-af7b-a7361821eeb8`

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

1. **Verified Employer Exists**:
   - Confirmed employer with contact `9995699955` exists in database
   - Employer ID: `f59de2e0-2b27-48ec-8c4a-44d2c5cc18af`
   - Company: "test"
   - Email: "princetraj@gmail.comm"

2. **Checked Backend API**:
   - CouponController search logic was correct:
   ```php
   $user = Employer::where('email', $identifier)
       ->orWhere('contact', $identifier)
       ->first();
   ```
   - API was correctly searching by both email and contact fields

3. **Found Frontend Bug**:
   - **The Issue**: In `CouponDetails.js`, the assign form was initialized with hardcoded type 'employee'
   ```javascript
   const [assignForm, setAssignForm] = useState([{identifier: '', type: 'employee'}]);
   ```
   - When assigning to an **employer coupon**, the form still had `type: 'employee'`
   - Backend API received wrong user type → searched Employee table instead of Employer table → User not found!

## ✅ The Fix

### Changes Made in `src/pages/coupons/CouponDetails.js`

1. **Changed Initial State** (Line 45):
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   const [assignForm, setAssignForm] = useState([{identifier: '', type: 'employee'}]);

   // After:
   const [assignForm, setAssignForm] = useState([]);
   ```

2. **Created New Handler** (Lines 76-82):
   ```javascript
   const handleOpenAssignDialog = () => {
     // Initialize form with correct type based on coupon
     if (coupon) {
       setAssignForm([{ identifier: '', type: coupon.coupon_for }]);
       setOpenAssignDialog(true);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Updated Button Click Handler** (Line 255):
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   onClick={() => setOpenAssignDialog(true)}

   // After:
   onClick={handleOpenAssignDialog}
   ```

4. **Updated Dialog Close Handlers** (Lines 313, 348):
   ```javascript
   // Dialog onClose and Cancel button now reset form:
   onClick={() => { setOpenAssignDialog(false); setAssignForm([]); }}
   ```

5. **Added Safety Checks** (Lines 320, 322):
   ```javascript
   // Prevent errors if coupon not loaded:
   {coupon?.coupon_for}
   {assignForm.length > 0 && assignForm.map(...)}
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Correct Flow

1. **User Opens Assign Dialog**:
   - `handleOpenAssignDialog()` is called
   - Checks if coupon exists
   - Initializes form with correct type from `coupon.coupon_for`
   - For employer coupon: `type: 'employer'`
   - For employee coupon: `type: 'employee'`

2. **User Enters Phone/Email**:
   - Form field captures identifier
   - Type is already set correctly

3. **User Submits**:
   - API receives correct type
   - Searches correct table (Employer or Employee)
   - Finds user successfully
   - Assigns to coupon

### Before vs After

| Scenario | Before (Bug) | After (Fixed) |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Employer Coupon + Phone | ❌ Searches Employee table → Not found | ✅ Searches Employer table → Found |
| Employee Coupon + Phone | ✅ Works (hardcoded 'employee') | ✅ Works (dynamic type) |
| Employer Coupon + Email | ❌ Searches Employee table → Not found | ✅ Searches Employer table → Found |
| Employee Coupon + Email | ✅ Works (hardcoded 'employee') | ✅ Works (dynamic type) |
